This the the last project i'm uploading that is\n              related with my studies. For this project i have to create a Movie\n              Streaming Platform (Not including any video player). This is a\n              platform with movies references i took from\n              https://www.tvmaze.com/api. As a member you can browse trough all\n              the movies added to the DataBase, subscribe to the one you saw and\n              also delete them. You can also modify your own details as a\n              Member. As a 'User' you can delete members, create, delete, and\n              edit Movies. There is a Log-In system included for Users with\n              special allowance. I will update about it soon...\n            </p>\n            <a href='https://github.com/yohan2095/Streaming-Platform-App'>\n              <Button variant='light'>Go to Github</Button>\n            </a>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n        <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default PortfolioComp;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
