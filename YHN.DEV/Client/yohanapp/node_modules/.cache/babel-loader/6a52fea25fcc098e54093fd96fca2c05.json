This the the last project i'm uploading that is related with my studies. For this project i have to create a Movie Streaming Platform (Not including any video player). This is a platform with movies references i took from https://www.tvmaze.com/api. As a member you can browse trough all the movies added to the DataBase, subscribe to the one you saw and also delete them. You can also modify your own details as a Member. As a 'User' you can delete members, create, delete, and edit Movies. There is a Log-In system included for Users with special allowance.\n\n                      I will update about it soon...</p>\n                      <a href='https://github.com/yohan2095/Streaming-Platform-App'>\n                      <Button variant=\"light\">Go to Github</Button>\n                      </a>\n                      </Col>\n              </Row>\n\n              <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br>\n          </div>\n\n\n\n          \n            \n            \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n  \n  export default PortfolioComp;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
